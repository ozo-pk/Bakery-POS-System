# Bakery POS System  

This project is a Bakery Point of Sale (POS) application developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course project.  
It is built using Java Swing, NetBeans GUI Builder, and MySQL.  

The system provides basic POS functionality such as product categories, cart management with discounts, receipt printing, and database integration for inventory and sales management.
